	<p3>INTRODUCTION</P3> <br>
	In this case study, Data Analyst performed many real worlds task of a Junior Data Analyst. They Imagined that they are working for Bellabeat, 
			a high-tech manufacturer of health-focus products for women, and meet different charaters and team members. In order to answer business 
			questions, data analyst followed the steps of the data analysis process <b> Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p3>Scenario</p3><br>
	Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the
			global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart
			device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. Data Analyst have been asked to focus on one of
			Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
			insights that they discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. Data Analyst present their analysis to the Bellabeat
			executive team along with their high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

	<p3> DATA ANALYSIS</p3>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p3> Ask Phase : </p3> It is a clear statement of a Business Task.<br><br>
	<p2>Business Task :</p2><br>
	Identify trends on how consumers use Bellabeat smart devices by focusing in one bellabeat product and analyze smart device data to gain insight 
				into how consumers are using their smart devices.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p3> Prepare Phase : </p3> A description of all data sources and used.<br><br>
	<p2>Specific Dataset:</p2> The dataset used was Fitbit Tracker data  from Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.<br>
	<p2>Descriptions :</p2> This Kaggle dataset contains a personal fitness tracker from thirty eligible users. Thirty eligible users consented to the 
				submission of personal tracker data, including minute level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset 
				was under an open source CCO 1.0 Universal license, which indicates that the person who associated the work with this deed has surrendered 
				all their rights to the work worldwide under copyright law and has dedicated it to the public domain.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p3> Process Phase :</p3> Documentation of any cleaning and manipulation of data.<br><br>
	<p2>Tool used :</p2> Data Analyst used Microsoft Excel since it performs data organizations, basic calculations, filtering and sorting, data cleaning, 
				pivot tables, and even data visualizations. Given the modest size of the gathered dataset, Excel proved to be well-suited platform for 
				processing and analyzing the data.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>Data Cleaning :</p2> Data Analyst performed data cleaning on a three major datasets which are dailyActivity_merged, hourlySteps_merged, sleepDay_merged. 
				These datasets are related to the Business Task.
	<br>
	<br>
	<p2>Data Cleaning Process :</p2><br>
	&emsp;* Find Duplicates Record.<br>
	&emsp;* Find Unique Values.<br>
	&emsp;* Find the missing values (Null Values).<br>
	&emsp;* Find the Typographical Errors.<br>
	&emsp;* Determine the No. of Rows<br>
	&emsp;* Determine the No. of Columns<br>
	&emsp;* Check the date format<br><br>
	<b>Note:</b> Data Cleaning is Iterative Process

	Overall, based on the findings presented in the article, Data Analyst concluded that the majority of users are actively using the smart device for fitness 
					tracking, but some users are unable to complete the full 31-day period. The device likely serves as a highly relevant purpose on the user's
					lives. Wearing the device for extended period suggest the development of daily habit or routine that involves using the device. Bellabeat 
					may see this as an opportunity to offer additional features or premium services to these highly users. Bellabeat smart device usually used
					to tracked the burned calorie. So, highlighting the calorie tracking feature in marketing materials and emphasize how users can benefit from it, 
					such as managing weight, monitoring fitness progress, and setting and achieving health goals.
					
	<br>
	
	<br>
	To improve the usage and completion rates of the smart device, it is recommended to further investigate why some users are unable to complete the full 
					31-day period and address any issues that may arise. It may also be helpful to provide additional support or resources to encourage users 
					to continue using the device. Additionally, understanding the users' demographics could provide insights into how to tailor the device to 
					better suit their needs. Finally, providing personalized feedback and recommendations based on the users' activity patterns could help 
					motivate them to continue using the smart device.
