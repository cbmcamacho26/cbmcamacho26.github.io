    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Identify trends in how consumers use Bellabeat smart devices by focusing in 
	one bellabeat product and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how 
	consumers are using their smart devices.</p>
	
	<h3>3. Data Overview</h3>
	
	<h3>3.1 Data Source</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;
	The data for this study was obtained from Mobius on Kaggle, who sourced it from Fitbit Fitness 
	Tracker Data. The data was collected over a period of one month, from April 12, 2016, to May 12, 
	2016, and involved 33 participants. It contains information on various aspects such as daily activity, 
	heart rate, calorie count, intensity, steps taken, sleep duration, and weight.
	</p>
	
	<h3>3.2 License and Accessibility</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;
	The dataset was under an open source CCO 1.0 Universal license, which indicates that the person 
	who associated the work with this deed has surrendered all their rights to the work worldwide under 
	copyright law and has dedicated it to the public domain.
	</p>
	
	<h3>3.3 Data Organization</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;
	The dataset is composed of 18 CSV files, but the study will solely focus on the information pertaining to the business objective. These files are
	dailyActivty_merged.csv, hourlySteps_merged.csv, sleepDay_merged.csv.
	</p>
	
	<h3>3.4 Data Integrity Verification</h3>

	<h3>4. Data Cleaning</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Data cleaning is an essential process in data analysis that involves identifying and correcting 
	errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. Excel is a widely used software for data cleaning due to its ease of use and flexibility.</p>
	
	<h3>4.1 Removing Duplicates Record</h3>
	<span>1. Select the range of cells that you want to check for duplicates.</span><br>
	<span>2. Click on the "Data" tab in the ribbon at the top of the Excel window.</span><br>
	<span>3. Click on the "Remove Duplicates" button in the "Data Tools" group.</span><br>
	<span>4. In the "Remove Duplicates" dialog box, select the columns that you want to use for identifying duplicates. By default, all columns are selected.</span><br>
	<span>5. Click on the "OK" button to remove the duplicate records.</span><br><br>
	<span>Excel will display a message box indicating how many duplicate records were removed. Click on the "OK" button to close the message box.</span>
	<h3>4.2 Verifying Distinct Values</h3>
	<span>1. Select the range of cells that you want to check for distinct values. This can be a single column or multiple columns.</span><br>
	<span>2. Click on the "Data" tab in the ribbon at the top of the Excel window.</span><br>
	<span>3. Click on the "Sort & Filter" button in the "Sort & Filter" group.</span><br>
	<span>4. In the drop-down menu, click on "Advanced" to open the "Advanced Filter" dialog box.</span><br>
	<span>5. In the "Advanced Filter" dialog box, choose "Copy to another location" option under "Action".</span><br>
	<span>6. In the "List range" field, enter the range of cells that you selected in step 2.</span><br>
	<span>7. In the "Copy to" field, specify a destination range where you want to paste the distinct values. Make sure the destination range has enough empty cells to accommodate the distinct values.</span><br>
	<span>8. Check the box next to "Unique records only" to filter for distinct values.</span><br>
	<span>9. Click on the "OK" button to apply the advanced filter and paste the distinct values to the specified destination range.</span><br><br>
	<span>Excel will copy only the distinct values to the destination range you specified, and you can now verify the distinct values in that range.</span><br>
	
	<h3>4.3 Formatting Data</h3>
	<span>1. Set the columns into the appropriate Data Types.</span><br>
	<span>2. The date in the dataset is not consistent so format the date into a single date format.</span><br>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;
	
	<h3>4.3 Removing Unnecessary Data</h3>
	<span>1. Remove the columns that do not included to the business task.</span><br>
	
	<h3>4.4 Verifying the Data</h3>
	<span>1. Check all the data, make sure that the process of data cleaning is followed.</span><br>
	
	<h3>5. Data Visualization</h3>
	
	
	<center><span>Figure 1</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/chart1.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/chart1.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:55%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 1</b> shows that only 21 out of 33 users were able to use the smart device for the entire duration of 31 days.
	However,  in this case study, the researcher analyzed trends and patterns using data from all of the users, to understand why some users
	were unable to complete the full 31-day period of using the smart device.
	</span>
	
	<h3>5.1 Days Used Smart Device</h3>
	<span>The researcher divided the 31 users into 3 Classifications: </span><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>1. High Use - Users who used their device between 21 to 31 days.</span><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>2. Moderate Use - Users who used their devices between 10 and 20 days.</span><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>3. Low Use - Users who used their devices between 1 and 10 days.</span><br><br>
	<center><span>Figure 2</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/figure2.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/figure2.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:40%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 2</b> shows that 29 out of 33 users are high use of the smart device, 
	3 out of 33 are moderate use and 1 out of 33 is low use. This means that the majority of the users are using smart devices.
	</span>
	
	<h3>5.2 Type of Users Based on Average Steps per Day</h3>
	<span>Based on <a href="https://www.1000steps.org.au/articles/counting-steps/" >www.1000steps.org.au</a>, the type of user will classify as follows:</span><br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>1. Sedentary - Less than and 5000 steps per day.</span><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>2. Lightly Active - Between 5000 and 7499 steps per day.</span><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>3. Fairly Active - Between 7500 and 9999 steps per day.</span><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;<span>4. Very Active - more than 10000 steps per day. </span><br><br>
	<center><span>Figure 3</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/figure3.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/figure3.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:30%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 3</b> shows the classifications of the users since the users have no demographic information. Those are 9 fairly active, 9 lightly active, 8 sedentary, and 7 very active with a total of 33 users.
	</span>
	
	<h3>5.3 Hourly Steps throughout the Day</h3>
	<center><span>Figure 4</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/figure4.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/figure4.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:50%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 4</b> shows that the  users are more active between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM with an average of 1500 steps and above.
	</span>
	
	<h3>5.4 Daily Steps per Weekday</h3>
	<center><span>Figure 5</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/figure5.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/figure5.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:30%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 5</b> shows that the  users are least active during Sunday and very active during Monday, Tuesday and Saturday. 
	</span>
	
	<h3>5.5 Smart Device Worn Time</h3>
	<center><span>Figure 6</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/figure6.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/figure6.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:55%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 6</b> shows the wearing time and not wearing time of the bellabeat smart device. Sunday with an average of 18.81 hours is least 
	average wearing time while Saturday with an average of 21.58 hours is the most active wearing time of the users.
	</span>
	
	<h3>5.6 Average Time Asleep per Day</h3>
	<center><span>Figure 7</span></center>
	<a href="images/proj/figure7.png"><span class="image main"><img src="images/proj/figure7.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width:30%;"/></span></a>
	<br>
	<span>&emsp;&emsp;<b>Figure 7</b> shows that Sunday with an average of 7.5 hours is the highest average time of the user when it comes to sleep and Tuesday and Thursday
	with an average of 6.7 hours is the lowest.
	</span>
	
	<h3>6.0 Conclusion and Recommendation</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Based on the findings presented in the article, it can be concluded that the majority of users are actively using the smart 
	device for fitness tracking, but some users are unable to complete the full 31-day period. The data also suggests that users are more 
	active during the weekdays and least active on Sundays. The users' wearing time and sleep patterns also vary throughout the week.
	</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To improve the usage and completion rates of the smart device, it is recommended to further investigate why some users are 
	unable to complete the full 31-day period and address any issues that may arise. It may also be helpful to provide additional support or
	resources to encourage users to continue using the device. Additionally, understanding the users' demographics could provide insights into 
	how to tailor the device to better suit their needs. Finally, providing personalized feedback and recommendations based on the users' activity 
	and sleep patterns could help motivate them to continue using the smart device.
